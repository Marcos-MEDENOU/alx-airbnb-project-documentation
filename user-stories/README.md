# ALX Airbnb Project Documentation
This repository contains the complete documentation for our Airbnb clone developed as part of the ALX project. It is a property booking platform that allows users to search, book, and pay for accommodations, as well as allowing property owners to list and manage their properties.

## User Stories
The user stories have been created from the use case diagram to capture the needs of different types of users (guests, hosts, administrators) in a more detailed and business value-oriented manner.

These stories follow the standard format:

- As a [user type]
- I want to [action/feature]
- So that [benefit/value]
The stories are prioritized to guide the development order.
